# This is an unofficial edit of BDTHPlugin for 6.3 until LeonBlade releases their own version

Add the following to your Dalamud custom repository list, under Settings -> Experimental:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gedwey/BDTHPlugin_6.3/main/plugin.json

You can find a good guide on this process over at https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Dalamud-Repo (just replace the repo URL mentioned there with the one above).

### Note that you will need to remove the original LeonBlade repo (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonBlade/DalamudPlugins/main/repo.json) from this list first, or else the two plugins might conflict and cause problems. I dunno if you need this but to be safe you probably should. In future you will need to remove mine and re-add LeonBlade's repo though, when BDTH is updated officially, to get the official releases again.

I have removed the original README so that the above info doesn't get lost, but please go to https://github.com/LeonBlade/DalamudPlugins for the official readme, code, and other related resources and info.

Note that I don't intend to support this myself now and into, and only made this edit because I wanted to use BDTH. I figured it would be useful for others too so I released it publically. I will happily answer questions or help out where possible though.
