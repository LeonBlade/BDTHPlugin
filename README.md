# This is an unofficial edit of BDTHPlugin for 6.3 until LeonBlade releases their own version

Add the following to your Dalamud custom repository list, under Settings -> Experimental:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gedwey/BDTHPlugin_6.3/main/plugin.json

You can find a good guide on this process over at https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Dalamud-Repo (just replace the repo URL mentioned there with the one above).

Once done, save the list and you should find BDTH listed as an unofficial edit in the title. If you see the original BDTH details you need to try again.

### Note that you will need to remove the original LeonBlade repo (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeonBlade/DalamudPlugins/main/repo.json) from this list first, or else the two plugins might conflict and cause problems. I dunno if you need this but to be safe you probably should. In future you will need to remove mine and re-add LeonBlade's repo though, when BDTH is updated officially, to get the official releases again.

# Original project

See the original project here, and for future official updates:
https://github.com/LeonBlade/BDTHPlugin

I have removed the original README so that the above info doesn't get lost, but please go to https://github.com/LeonBlade/DalamudPlugins for the official readme, code, and other related resources and info.

Note that I don't intend to support this myself now and into the future, and only made this edit because I wanted to use BDTH. I figured it would be useful for others too so I released it publically. I will happily answer questions or help out where possible though.
